# Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Project: Restaurant Reviews Stage 1

This is a restaurant reviews app that was originally static, not responsive, lacking accessibility features and offline functionally. As part of the Udacity front-end nanodregree, this project consisted of solving the previous issues mentioned and transforming this app into a mobile friendly website.

## Getting Started

clone (or fork) this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/josh-W42/mws-restaurant-stage-1
```

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

## Built With Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
